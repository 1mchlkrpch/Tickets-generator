    "- If you make too many questions of a particular difficulty level, do not forget that your tickets will be quite long and you will have to move the output of a new ticket to a new page more often (<em>That is, on the page</em> `a4paper` <em> You can fit either 4 short or 2 long tickets; this is done by moving to a new page in the</em>`print_package` function)\n",

    "     - $k$ is the topic number (<em>numbers greater than 9 are allowed</em>)\n",
